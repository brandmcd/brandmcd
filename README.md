# Hi! I'm Brandon!
#### I am a highschool junior at the Frederick V. Pankow Center. I'm passionate about programming and game design, and I have completed various projects that showcase my abilities in these fields.
#### I have worked with the Unity Game Engine utilizing the C# programming language for game development. In addition, I have experience with the Java programming language.
### Here are some examples of my past projects and experience:

### Rent Day!
#### September 2022
##### To begin my Junior year and my C# Programming and Game Design Class, I created a game in Unity called Rent Day! Rent Day is a text-based adventure game where the player plays as a landlord. The goal of the game is to collect rent from tenants and make decisions. This project was a great way to learn about story-telling through game design.
##### This was also my first project I was able to publish online using WebGL! You can play the game [here](https://brandonmcdonald.itch.io/rent-day)

### Astral Encounter
#### January-February 2023
###### Astral Encounter was my final project for my first semester of C# Programming and Game Design. It is an arcade game where you play as a spaceship and travel to different planets collecting power-ups in the hope of getting the best score. The game uses the Firebase database to hold high scores, allowing players to compete with each other for the top spot. The game is still on the classroom arcade machine!
