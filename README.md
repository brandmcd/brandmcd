## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### 🏃‍♂️ iGym – AR Exergame System (SURE Research)
- Refactored and optimized a **ROS 2 + OpenCV** computer vision pipeline, reducing per-frame detection latency from 12ms → 5ms.  
- Built a **multi-threaded architecture** (capture, detection, publishing) to achieve higher throughput and smoother real-time tracking.  
- Integrated **Kalman filtering + Hungarian algorithm** for robust multi-player tracking with reduced ID switching.  
- Extended system to support **Unity Netcode + Relay** for synchronous multiplayer play, designing distributed authority models.  \
