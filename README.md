## 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon

🎓 **Robotics Engineering** undergraduate at the **University of Michigan**  
🔬 Undergraduate researcher on **iGym (AR/XR systems for inclusive play)**  

I build and study **full-stack robotic systems**, with a growing research interest in **perceptual reasoning** and **semantic understanding** for interactive and human-in-the-loop robotics.

---

### 🧠 Research Interests
- Real-time robot perception and tracking  
- Perceptual reasoning under noise, occlusion, and latency  
- Semantic understanding for interaction-aware systems  
- End-to-end robotics systems spanning sensing, networking, and rendering

### 🔬 Selected Experience
- Refactored and multithreaded **ROS 2 + OpenCV** perception pipelines, reducing latency **12 ms → 5 ms**  
- Implemented **Kalman filtering + Hungarian matching** for stable multi-target tracking  
- Profiled **end-to-end latency** across camera capture, ROS messaging, networking, and Unity rendering  
- Co-authored and presented a live demo at **ACM MobiCom 2025**

**FIRST Robotics & Mentorship**  
- President, **FIRST Alumni & Mentors Network at Michigan (FAMNM)**  
- Mentor FRC and FTC teams in **control systems, Java, and subsystem design**  
- Support and lead large-scale robotics competitions and outreach programs
